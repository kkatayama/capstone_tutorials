# Proposal Format

## 4-6 pages (can be longer)
* Page lengths are based on pages being 12 point font (or smaller)
* Page lengths are based on pages being "singled spaced"
* Recommend you use Google doc format to allow for simultaneous team editing.
* ==The 1st cut" proposals can be text, but as the DRAFT and FINAL PROPOSALS must contain block
    diagrams, etc., please submit the DRAFT and FINAL PROPOSAL as a PDF file.==
    
## Proposal Outline (detail section with prose, can use bullet or tables for schedules or lists)

* Title of the Project  (e.g. "Wall Mapping Robot")
* ONE or MULTI-WORD HYPHENATED Short Team Name (**related to the project** e.g. wall-mapping robot, team name ["ROVER"]())
  - the short team name can be Hyphenated, e.g. ["BLUE-TEETH"](), and/or "Camel Case", e.g. ["BlueTeeth"]() or ["Blue-Teeth"]()
* A One-Sentence Project Description
* List Team Members and Likely Responsibilities
* Objectives / Goals](paragraphs)
  - what are you going to design and build?
  - what is the specific "mission" of the project? e.g. for a wireless sensor project, "detect intruders and notify"
  - describe what is a success?
  - describe what is a failure?
  - who is your customer?
  - specify constraints on the design, e.g. size, weight, performance, interfaces, cost (i.e. $200)
  - detail specific Fall goals (experiments, tests, prototypes) and specific Spring goals (finished system, results)
  - ==The team should complete a reasonable prototype at the end of the fall semester;  describe that prototype (e.g. “circuit prototypes and early software demonstrating the functions of the proposed project”)==

* Approach (paragraphs and bullets)
  - overall scheme, design approach, design using ?
  - build this, integrate that, write this software, etc.
  - how to test, debug, etc.
* Block Diagram (whatever makes sense - system, hardware, software) is REQUIRED
  - can be hand-drawn (take a photo)
* Equipment Needed (bullets)
  - a rough idea of components  (hardware, software, etc.) and other equipment needed (test equipment, etc.)
* Budget (assume $200 for now) (bullets)
  - cost if you know it or can estimate
* Plan/Schedule](across 2 semesters, provide more detail for Fall) (table or bullets)
  - a rough guess at the time frame to accomplish steps in the approach
  - milestones - these are defined points which demonstrate you are making progress toward your goal
* Challenges (paragraphs or bullets)
  - what is going to be hard (or hard for your team)
  - equipment that you don't understand
  - skills you need or have to learn
* References (if any)
* Include drawings if that helps explain the problem (can be hand-drawn and scanned/photographed)
