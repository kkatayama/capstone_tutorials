# Proposal Format

## 4-6 pages (can be longer)
* Page lengths are based on pages being 12 point font (or smaller)
* Page lengths are based on pages being "singled spaced"
* Recommend you use Google doc format to allow for simultaneous team editing.
* Please submit the DRAFT and FINAL PROPOSAL as a PDF file
    
## Proposal Outline 

* Title of the Project (e.g. **"Wall Mapping Robot"**)
* ONE or MULTI-WORD HYPHENATED Short Team Name (e.g. **"ROVER"**)  
  - short team name can be Hyphenated and/or CamelCase (e.g. **"BLUE-TEETH"**, **"BlueTeeth"**, or **"Blue-Teeth"**)
* A short, one-paragraph, multi-sentence overview of the project in the form of an abstract or small executive summary
* List Team Members and Likely Responsibilities
* Objectives (paragraphs)
  - what are you going to design and build?
  - what is the specific "mission" of the project? e.g. for a wireless sensor project, "detect intruders and notify"
  - describe what is a success?
  - describe what is a failure?
  - who is your customer?
* Design Constraints
  - specify constraints on the design, e.g. size, weight, performance, interfaces, cost (i.e. $200)
* Goals 
  - detail specific Fall goals (experiments, tests, prototypes) and specific Spring goals (finished system, results)
* Prototype
  - **The team should complete a reasonable prototype at the end of the fall semester;**
  - describe that prototype  
    (e.g. “circuit prototypes and early software demonstrating the functions of the proposed project”)
* Approach (paragraphs and bullets)
  - overall scheme, design approach, design using ?
  - build this, integrate that, write this software, etc.
  - how to test, debug, etc.
* **Block Diagram (whatever makes sense - system, hardware, software) is REQUIRED**
  - can be hand-drawn (take a photo)
* Equipment Needed (bullets)
  - a rough idea of components  (hardware, software, etc.) and other equipment needed (test equipment, etc.)
* Budget (assume $200 for now) (bullets)
  - cost if you know it or can estimate
* Plan/Schedule (across 2 semesters, provide more detail for Fall) (table or bullets)
  - a rough guess at the time frame to accomplish steps in the approach
  - milestones - these are defined points which demonstrate you are making progress toward your goal
* Challenges (paragraphs or bullets)
  - what is going to be hard (or hard for your team)
  - equipment that you don't understand
  - skills you need or have to learn
* References (if any)
  - include drawings if that helps explain the problem (can be hand-drawn and scanned/photographed)
